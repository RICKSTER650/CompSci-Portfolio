    <p id="me">Who am I?</p>
    <p id="summary">That's the main question of this website.  I am a 17 year old mexican-american Senior taking classes at a school called Summit Preporatory Charter Highschool. One of these classes is computer science which is where I learned to do all this. I'm getting ready to move on out of here and go on to College where I will study for a major in mechanical engineering. I find an interest in cars and want to learn how to build one and create my own someday. It's an interest I have along with a couple of others:</p>
