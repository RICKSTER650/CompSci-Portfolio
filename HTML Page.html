    <p id="html">Lets talk about HTML</p>
    <p id="sumhtml">So what is HTML? Well HTML is short for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to create a "<em>skeleton</em>" for a website. If you think of HTML and CSS as a human body then HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the skin and everything else, but we'll get into CSS later. HTML is used to create a website's words and information. It's mostly for putting in and arranging text into the website. This method of coding came from a man called Tim Berners-Lee. HTML like a bunch of other coding techniques are like languages used to input things into the computer. HTML is written in a form of <strong>tags</strong> surrounded by these <strong><></strong>. It looks something like the pic to the left.</p>

    <p id="css">Now let's discuss CSS</p>
    <p id="sumcss">CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is, as I said earlier, the skin and rest of the body. It's used to decorate the website and make it more colorful. It's used for editing the HTML to give it color, making words bigger, designing buttons, etc. It's what makes this site purple and grey and makes the words white. CSS was made up by a man named Hakon Wium Lie. Unlike HTML where you use tags, CSS uses the tags but only the words inside the tags without the<>, and in between these {} is where all the editing goes. The editing is mostly in the form where you put in what you are going to change like color or font-size and put a colon next to it. Then on the other side of that colon you put how you are making the change lke after color: you would put red. There's an example to the left</p>

    <p id="tags">Tags</p>
    <p id="sumtags">Tags are the things I was discussing earlier for HTML. They are specific words that are in between <> and are used to tell the computer what part of the page you are editing. You would write one like this  < title >blahblahblah< /title >. This is an example of one and this tag tells the computer what the name of the tab should be for the website. If you look at the tab name at the top it says HTML Page, and that's because in between< title> and < /title> I said HTML Page. Some tags are < p >< /p >, < ul >< /ul >, < ol >< /ol >, and < li >< /li >. P stands for paragraph and is used to write regular text just like what I used for this paragraph, and ul stands for unorganized list and it's used to make a list without numbers, just like the links to my other sites are. < ol >< /ol > stands for organized list and its like my links but this time instead of bullet points it is a numbered list, and < li >< /li > stands for list and is what you use at the side of each thing in the list each time you use a new bullet point or number. Some specific tags are to the left. </p>

      <p id="attributes">Attributes</p>
      <p id="sumattributes">Attributes are used right after a tag and are used to provide additional information on what it will look like. One example is if you want to improve a paragraph or < p > you would write it like this < p style="Here's where you put in what you're editing">here's where your text goes< /p >. A detailed example is to the left. </p>

        <p id="conclusion">Well that's pretty much it for HTML and CSS. It's a mouthful but if you keep on practicing you'll get the hang of it and everything will make more sense. Don't forget to check out my other sites.</p>
